# The code is creating a set called `set` that contains a collection of elements. Sets are unordered
# collections of unique elements, meaning that duplicate values are not allowed. In this case, the set
# contains the elements 'Avijit', 7, 0.7, 'Avi', 19, and 20.
set = {'Avijit', 7, 0.7, 'Avijit', 'Avi', 19, 19, 20}
