# # # Escape sequence cnaracters
# # To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an
# # escape sequence character.
# # An escape sequence character is a backslash \ followed by the character
# # you want to insert.
# # An example of a character that cannot be directly used in a string is a
# # double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
# print( "This doesn't "execute" )
# print( "This will \" execute" )
# output
# This will " execute
# point 2>>>>
# In Python, \n is a type of escape character that will create a new line when used.
